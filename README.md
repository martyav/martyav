I'm a technical writer. I've written docs for the Wikimedia Foundation, Microsoft, and SUSE. 

I currently work for 32BJ Funds, a nonprofit that administers benefits for the local SEIU chapter in New York. SEIU is the North American service workers union.

From May to Nov 2022, I contributed to the Domino Data Lab docs through my account at https://github.com/ddl-mavedon.
